# The following properties are used for automated testing.
#
testing:
  #
  # Add network dependencies that will be used when running integration tests.
  #
  # You can include any standard blossm procedure thats within your network
  # by specifying 'procedure', 'service', and 'domain' properties. Also include
  # a 'name' property if you're mocking a command. These procedure within your network that
  # are included in dependencies will run during integration test based on the latest published image.
  #
  # To mock calls to blossm services outside of your network, or any other http service,
  # set 'procedure' to 'http', and 'host' to the host where the service lives (exclude the http protocol prefix).
  # Then, set a 'mocks' property as an array of objects that describe how calls should behave.
  # The 'mocks' should include 'method' as 'get', 'post', 'put', and 'delete', 'path' as
  # the path that the mock applies to (or * if the mock should be used for any path on this host),
  # 'code' as the status code that the mock returns, and 'response' as the http response the mock returns.
  #
  dependencies:
    - domain: some-domain
      procedure: event-store
      service: some-service

  #
  # Add each integration test you want to run as a 'step'.
  #
  # The 'pre' property is an array of instructions that allow you to set up the event state
  # of the system before the integration test runs. For example, you can add an event to
  # an event-store by setting the 'domain' and 'service' property to the domain and service
  # of the event-store that you want to modify the state of, 'root' and 'action' to the root
  # and action that describe the event, and 'payload' to the payload of the event that is
  # being added.
  #
  # The 'query' property is the query that should be used in this integration test step.
  #
  # The 'context' property is the context that should be used in this integration test step.
  # Leave it out if no context should be passed in.
  #
  # The 'root' property is the root that should be used in this integration test step.
  # Leave it out if no root should be passed in.
  #
  # The 'response' property is the response body that is expected to be returned.
  # If the expected value of a response property is not known ahead of time, leave
  # it's value empty.
  #
  # The 'code' property is the response code that is expected to be returned.
  # If a 'response' is provided, this defaults to 200.
