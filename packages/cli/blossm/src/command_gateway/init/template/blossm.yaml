# Specify the commands that this gateway should accept requests for.

# The 'name' property correlates to the command name.
# Each command can be accessed by adding the URL path /<name> to the core URL.
#
# The 'privileges' property describes the privileges needed by the requester
# to access this command. Set this to 'none' if no specific privileges are needed,
# but the route should still require by a valid token.
#
# The 'context' property describes which property in the requesting token's context
# that the specified privileges should refer to.
# If a context is specified but it isn't found, the 'redirect' is used.
#
# Set the 'protection' property to 'none' if this route should be accessible by
# anyone on the internet. Set 'protection' to 'context' if the route should be
# accessible by anyone on the internet, but if a valid token is used, then
# the request context should be parsed from it and passed along to the command.
